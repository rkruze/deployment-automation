# Kubernetes Helm Chart



**Early Access**



This is the Helm Chart for [Redpanda](https://vectorized.io). A Helm Chart is a collection of files used to describe a set of Kubernetes resources, and may be used to deploy and manage Redpanda in a cloud such as AWS or GCP.



## Local Installation

For development purposes, it can be installed locally on Linux or Mac OS.

* The containers Kubernetes uses are typically Docker ones, so install that first: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

* To create a Kubernetes cluster, you need a tool such as `kind`. The install instructions are here: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/. (minikube is also popular but it is only good for single-node clusters.)

* To install the Redpanda Helm Chart you will need `Helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

* To run extra commands against the cluster you need `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

* Clone this repository (`deployment-automation`).

  

## Local Usage

- Navigate to this folder (`kubernetes`).

- Run `kind create cluster`

- Run `helm install --namespace redpanda --create-namespace redpanda ./redpanda`. This will read the Helm Chart in the redpanda folder and deploy the Redpanda Docker image (the latest from Docker Hub) to pods. For now it just creates a basic 3 node Redpanda cluster. The `redpanda` namespace will be created if it does not already exist.

- At this stage you will get further instructions in the terminal about how to run `rpk` in the cluster.

  


## Development

- Run `helm list` and  `kubectl get deployments`. These commands will show how many replicas in the cluster were successful in starting up and are available.
- Run `kubectl get pods`. This shows the pods (groups of containers) that are running. You will see pod names, e.g. `redpanda-1605313023`.
- To see the log for Redpanda on one of the pods, run  `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
- For troubleshooting, this command is also useful: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.
- To clean up, run `helm uninstall redpanda`. The cluster will still be running, just without Redpanda.
- To experiment, edit the `redpanda/values.yaml` file, and run `helm install redpanda ./redpanda` again.
